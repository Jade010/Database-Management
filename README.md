# Database Management Repository
Welcome to my Database Management Repository! This repository contains a collection of my projects across various aspects of database management. It showcases my skills in SQL query formulation, database design and relational data modeling (RDM), the implementation of constraints and triggers, as well as my proficiency in database normalization. Each folder within this repository represents a specific form of database management, containing projects that highlight my technical abilities and problem-solving approach. This repository is designed to demonstrate my background and experience using different dialects of SQL.

## Using This Repository
Each folder consists of various projects and each project includes an overview, objective, highlighted techniques, and insights gained.
