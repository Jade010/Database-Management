# SQL Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository contains my projects and assignments demonstrating my skills and proficiency in SQL, Database design, Data Analysis, and querying. 

## About Me
Structured Query Language (SQL) is one of my favorite programming languages to use. I have a strong interest in database design, database administration, analytics, and visualization. While this repository contains work I've done as a Data Analytics student at Washington State University, it also contains projects I've enjoyed creating outside of my degree. For me, working with data is like working on a puzzle, it continuously makes you think and can be really fun to work on! I have always been a very detail-oriented and project based person and so when I found Data Analytics I developed a strong connection to the field. I am always looking to improve my work and gain new skills so I often update this repository.  

## Key Areas of Focus:
- **Data Querying & Manipulation:** 
  - Writing complex SQL queries
  - Performing data manipulation using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
  - Performing data filtering and sorting using WHERE, IN, LIKE, and ORDER BY.
- **Data Aggregation & Analysis:**
  - Aggregating data using GROUP BY and HAVING.
  - Aggregating functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN to derive meaningful insights from data.
  - Creating subqueries for complex data analysis.
- **Database Design & Normalization:**
  - Implementing database normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
  - Creating and managing tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures.
- **Data Joining & Relationship Management:**
  - Using JOIN operations to merge data from multiple tables.
  - Understanding of relational database concepts and foreign key contraints.
  - Handeling complex multi-table joins and unions.
- **Data Visualization & Reporting:**
  - Presenting data analysis results in a clear manner for any audience.
  - Integrating SQL with data visualization tools (like Tableau and PowerBI) for enhancing reporting.
  - Creating dashboards and reports that aid in decision-making.
- **Data Security:**
  - Understanding data privacy and security practices in SQL databases.
 
  Feel free to look at my various projects, each folder is its own unique project. I am always looking to improve my work and gain new skills so I often update this repository. I also love to get feedback and would love to connect to discuss any opportunities or just to make connections. You can reach me on [My LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jade-aidoghie).
