# Database Management Portfolio Repository
Welcome to my Database Management Portfolio Repository! This repository is a curated collection of my projects and demonstrations across various aspects of database management. It showcases my skills in SQL query formulation, database design and relational data modeling (RDM), the implementation of constraints and triggers, as well as my proficiency in database normalization and understanding of functional dependencies. Each folder within this repository represents a specific domain of database management, containing projects that highlight my technical abilities and problem-solving approach.

## Folders Overview
Complex Queries
 - **Description:** This folder contains projects that demonstrate my proficiency in crafting sophisticated SQL queries to address complex data retrieval and analysis requirements. Here, you'll find examples of advanced query techniques such as joins, window functions, aggregation, and pattern matching.
- **Techniques Used:** Data Retrieval, Joins, Advanced Query Structures, Analytical Functions, Conditional Logic, Data Aggregation and Summarization, and Query Optimization.

Database Design and RDM
- **Description:** Projects within this folder focus on the initial stages of database creation, including requirement analysis, ER diagrams, and the translation of those diagrams into relational model structures. This section underscores my capability to conceptualize and design efficient, logical databases from scratch.
- **Techniques Used:** Requirement Analysis, ER Diagramming, Relational Schema Design, Normalization.

Constraints and Triggers
- **Description:** Here, I showcase my skills in enhancing database integrity and automating database management tasks using constraints and triggers. The projects illustrate my understanding of data integrity enforcement and the dynamic capabilities provided by triggers.
- **Techniques Used:** Primary and Foreign Keys, Check Constraints, Unique Constraints, Trigger-based Automation and Logic Implementation.

Normalization and Dependencies
- **Description:** This folder emphasizes my ability to optimize database schemas through normalization and manage functional dependencies. The projects present my approach to minimizing redundancy, avoiding update anomalies, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Techniques Used:** Normalization (1NF to 3NF and beyond), Identification and Application of Functional Dependencies, Schema Refinement.

## Purpose
This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in database management. Through these projects, I aim to showcase my abilities in efficiently designing, querying, and managing databases, making me a valuable asset to any team or project requiring deep database expertise.
