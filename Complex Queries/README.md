# Complex Queries Portfolio

## Overview
This folder consists of examples showcasing my knowledge on complex querying. Each file is an individual assignment I've worked on in my Data Analytics Degree and Data Analytics Certificate program. Each query answers a question about the databases I am using.

## SQL Platforms Used
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite
  
## Techniques
This folder demonstrates my use of SQL commands and concepts to manage and analyze data effectively. Below are the techniques and features applied:
- **Data Retrieval**: Utilized **SELECT** statements and **DISTINCT** keyword to fetch unique records, ensuring efficient data extraction and avoiding duplicate rows.
- **Joins and Set Operations**: Extensively used **JOIN** operations, including **INNER**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, and **FULL JOIN**, to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. This approach allows for a thorough analysis of relational data.
- **Advanced Query Structures**: Implemented Nested Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to enhance the readability and maintenance of complex queries. CTEs, in particular, provide a cleaner and more readable structure by allowing temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SQL statement.
- **Analytical Functions**: Leveraged Window functions for advanced data analysis tasks, such as calculating running totals, ranking results, and performing row-by-row operations within a specified frame, enabling sophisticated data insights.
- **Conditional Logic**: Employed **CASE** statements to execute conditional logic directly within SQL queries, offering a flexible way to perform data transformation based on specific criteria.
- **Data Aggregation and Summarization**: Utilized aggregation functions (**GROUP BY**, **SUM**, **AVG**, **COUNT**, **MAX**, **MIN**) to summarize data, providing insights into the dataset by calculating totals, averages, counts, and identifying maximum and minimum values.
- **Data Filtering and Sorting**: Applied **WHERE** and **HAVING** clauses for data filtering based on specific conditions and **ORDER BY** clause with **ASC** and **DESC** options to sort the results, ensuring targeted data analysis and presentation.
- **Pattern Matching**: Used **LIKE**, **SIMILAR TO**, and other regular expressions for pattern matching to filter rows based on specific text patterns, enhancing the capability to perform complex data searches.
- **Data Modification and Management**: Demonstrated the use of **UPDATE** and **SET** commands for modifying existing records, and **SELECT * INTO FROM** for copying data from one table into a new table, facilitating dynamic data manipulation and storage.
- **Query Optimization**: Focused on query optimization techniques to improve the performance of SQL queries, ensuring faster execution times and efficient data retrieval.
- **Complex Queries**: Translated complex business requirements into SQL queries to accurately retrieve and analyze data, showcasing the ability to handle real-world data challenges effectively.
