# Complex Queries Folder

## Overview
This folder is dedicated to SQL and NoSQL queries I've performed on various databases. Databases are able to handle large volumes of data and allow us to quickly access this data and perform real time analysis. I have worked with different databases academically, professionally, and create my own personal SQL and NoSQL databases. Working with databases and being able to extract answers from this data is my passion and I'm constantly looking to improve my techniques, how I formulate queries, and my automation skills. Some projects will evolve with time as I find new ways of improving my work and optimizing my queries.
