# Database Design Project

This project showcases my comprehensive skills in database design, data architecture, ER modeling, and security design in SQL. The project simulates a real-world scenario where I conceptualized and developed a database for the Department of Licensing. The project follows a structured approach to database design. It includes the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on gathered information, translaton of this diagram into a relational model, development of the SQL database, and refinement of the database schema, including normalization and physical design considerations. Additionally, it covers the aspects of application security design within the database.

### File Structure and Contents
1. DesignInstructions.md
    - Outlines the intital design concepts and considerations for the faux Department of Licensing database.
2. ELD_ERDesign.pdf
    - Contains the ER diagram developed based on the initial design concepts. This diagram details all relevant entities, their attributes,
    - keys, relationships, key constraints, and participations constraints.
3. LD_RelationalMapping.sql
    - Translates the ER diagram into a realtional model and includes SQL scripts for creating the database. This file demonstrates
    - the practical application of ER-to-relational mapping techniques and the actual creation of the database in SQL.
4. Security.sql
    - Focuses on schema refinement, including normalization processes, physical database design, and the implementation of applicaton
    - security measures. This file is crucial for ensuring the efficiency, integrity, and security of the database.

## Methodology
- **Data Architecture and Database Design:** Application of structured methods to design a database tailored to the specific needs of a licensing department.
- **ER Modeling:** Creating detailed and accurate ER diagrams to represent complex data relationships and constraints.
- **SQL Development** Use of SQL for database creation, including table definitions, relationships, and constraints.
- **Schema Refinement and Normalization:** Ability to optimize database schema for performance and reliability.
- **Physical Database Design:** Understanding of how to structure a database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Security Design in Databases:** Implementation of security measures within the database to protect sensitive information.
