# This repository contains my practice work with PIVOT() commands and matrix tables within PowerBI. The main focus is on a dataset containing information about calories 
# burned by various types of physical activities, ranging from household chores such as cleaning, to competitive sports.

# The goal of this project is to prepare different suggested activities plans for people who want to track and increase their caloric burn. This is especially useful 
# for fitness enthusiasts, health-conscious individuals, and anyone interested in maintaining or improving their physical wellbeing.The subjects are categorized into 
# four weight categories averaging 130 lbs, 155 lbs, 180 lbs, and 205 lbs. Each of these categories receives a personalized activity plan based on the data analysis.
