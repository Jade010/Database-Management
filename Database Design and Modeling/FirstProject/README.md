# Data Management Assignment
This was the first assignment I had at Washington State University where I used SQL and created data models using visio. The goal of this assignment was to become familiar with single entities and one-to-many entities as well as getting a basic understanding of database management.
  
## Instructions:  
The goal of this assignment was to draw data models using visio, turn this into a relational database, and then add 3 rows to the tables based on the following information.  

1. **Employee:** An employee has an employee number, name, department, phone, and email.
2. **Dog:** A dog has a name, date of birth, breed (e.g., Portuguese water dog), and an owner.
3. A department manages many projects, and a project is assigned to at most one department. For each department capture the department name, budget code, office number, and phone number. For each project capture the project id, project name, max hours, start date, end date, and department

## File Structure and Contents
1. [DataModel.pdf](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FirstProject/DataModel.pdf)
    - Contains the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram created in Visio based on the instructions above. This diagram details all relevant entities, their attributes, and constraints.
3. [RelationalModels.sql](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FirstProject/RelationalModels.sql)
    - Translates the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram into a relational model and includes SQL scripts for creating the database. This also includes the code used to insert 3 rows into each example.
