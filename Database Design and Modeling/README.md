# Database Design and Relational Modeling Projects

## Overview
This folder is a key component of my SQL/Database portfolio, focusing on the different aspects of database design and modeling. It showcases my analytical skills in requirement analysis, creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, and my ability to construct relational models that represent real world logic. Each project within this folder demonstrates a step-by-step approach from initial requirements gathering to the final database design.

## Contents
- **Requirement Analysis Documents:** Contains details on the project requirements, outlining the data needs, business rules, and constraints that shape the design of database systems. These documents serve as the foundation for developing effective and efficient database.
- **ER Diagrams:** Features a collection of Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams that visually represent the database schema based on the requirement analyses. These diagrams illustrate the entities, their relationships, and key attributes, providing a clear blueprint for the database structure.
- **Relational Model Structures:** Presents the translation of ER diagrams into relational models, including tables, primary and foreign keys, and normalization.

## Projects
1. [Department of Licensing Database Design](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/DeptOfLicensingProject)
     * This is one of my first database design projects for a Department of Licensing scenario.
2. [Jade's Online Certificate Programs Database Design](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/JadesOnlineEducationProject)
     * This project consists of a database design for an online education platform where subscriptions are offered to learn various topics through instructor led courses. Students can earn a certificate by paying for the exam and passing.
3. [Gourmet Food Club](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/GourmetFoodClub)
     * This assignment is based on a Gourmet food club where I practiced creating tables & inserting into these tables in SQL as well as creating data models in Microsoft Visio.
4. [FreightProject](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FreightProject)
     * This assignment is based on a freight table taken from a mail order catalog. It involves the creation of a database as well as inserting data into this database and querying.
