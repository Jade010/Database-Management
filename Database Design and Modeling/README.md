# Database Design and Modeling Portfolio

## Overview
This folder will contain various database design and modeling projects I have conducted. Each folder is a unique project showcasing my skills in retrieving business insights to create a database schema, the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on this information, and then translating this to a relational database utilizing different SQL platforms.

## Projects
