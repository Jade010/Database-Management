# Database Design and Relational Modeling Portfolio

## Overview
This folder contains various database design and relatonal modeling projects I've worked on. Each folder is a unique project showcasing my skills in conducting business analysis, creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams based on this information, translating this to a relational database utilizing different SQL platforms, and normalization. My work ranges from assignments I've worked on in my Data Analytics Degree to personal projects I worked on for fun. Below is a directory for each project and short description.
