# Database Design and Relational Modeling Projects

## Overview
This folder is a key component of my larger SQL/Database portfolio, focusing on the foundational aspects of database design and modeling. It showcases my analytical skills in requirement analysis, my proficiency in creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, and my ability to construct detailed relational model structures. Each project within this folder demonstrates a step-by-step approach from initial requirements gathering to the final database design, highlighting my comprehensive understanding of database systems.

## Contents
- **Requirement Analysis Documents:** Contains detailed analyses of project requirements, outlining the data needs, business rules, and constraints that shape the design of database systems. These documents serve as the foundation for developing effective and efficient database models.
- **ER Diagrams:** Features a collection of Entity-Relationship diagrams that visually represent the database schemas designed based on the requirement analyses. These diagrams illustrate the entities, their relationships, and key attributes, providing a clear blueprint for the database structure.
- **Relational Model Structures:** Presents the translation of ER diagrams into relational models, including tables, primary and foreign keys, and normalization processes. These structures are meticulously crafted to ensure data integrity and optimize performance, reflecting best practices in relational database design.

## Purpose
The Database Design & Modeling folder is intended to highlight my methodical approach to database design, from conceptualization to implementation. It evidences my ability to analyze requirements, visualize database structures, and develop efficient relational models, showcasing my skills to potential employers or collaborators.

## Projects
1. [Department of Licensing Database Design](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/DeptOfLicensingProject)
     * This is one of my first database design projects for a Department of Licensing scenario.
2. [Jade's Online Certificate Programs Database Design](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/JadesOnlineEducationProject)
     * This project creates a database for an online education platform where subscriptions are offered to learn various topics through instructr led courses. Students can earn a certificate by paying for the exam and passing.
3. [Gourmet Food Club](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/GourmetFoodClub)
     * This assignment is based on a Gourmet food club where I practiced creating tables & inserting into these tables in SQL as well as creating data models in Microsoft Visio.
4. [FreightProject](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/tree/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FreightProject)
     * This assignment is based on a freight table taken from a mail order catalog. It involves the creation of a database as well as inserting data into this database and querying.
