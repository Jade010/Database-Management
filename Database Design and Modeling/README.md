# Database Design and Relational Modeling Portfolio

## Overview
This folder will contain various database design and modeling projects I've worked on. Each folder is a unique project showcasing my skills in retrieving business insights to create a database schema, the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on this information, and then translating this to a relational database utilizing different SQL platforms. My work ranges from assignments I've worked on in my Data Analytics Degree to personal projects I worked on for fun. Below is a directory for each project and short description.
