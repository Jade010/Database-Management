# Jades Certificate Platform Database Design

This is a personal project I created while thinking of a certificate I wanted obtain in the future. This project represents an online education platform that allows users to take exams to receive a certificate in their field and subscribe to the platform for more resourses. This project showcases my skills in designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on an application, translating this to a relational database (MySQL), and database schema refinement such as triggers, normalization, and physical design considerations. 

## File Structure and Contents
1. [BootcampSchema.md](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/JadesOnlineEducationProject/BootcampSchema.md)
    - Outlines the intital design concepts and considerations for an online education application.
2. [JadesBootcampERDiagram.pdf](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/JadesOnlineEducationProject/JadesBootcampERDiagram.pdf)
    - Contains the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram developed based on the initial design concepts. This diagram details all relevant entities, their attributes, relationships, key constraints, and participations constraints.
3. [JadesBootcampRelationalModel.sql](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/JadesOnlineEducationProject/JadesBootcampRelationalModel.sql)
    - Translates the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram into a relational model and includes SQL scripts and triggers for creating the database. This file demonstrates the practical application of ER-to-relational mapping techniques and the creation of the database using MySQL.

## Skills
- **Database Design:** Application of structured methods to design a database tailored to the specific needs of a company.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** Creating detailed and accurate ER diagrams to represent complex data relationships and constraints.
- **SQL Development** Use of SQL for database creation, including table definitions, relationships, and constraints.
- **Schema Refinement and Normalization:** Ability to optimize database schema for performance and reliability.
- **Physical Database Design:** Understanding of how to structure a database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
