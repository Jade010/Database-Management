# Friegth Database Design
This is a small database design project I created while studying at Washington State University. The goal of this project was to create a database off of a freight table taken from a mail order catalog. I then needed to populate the tables and perform queries answering questions about the data. This project showcases my skills in designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on company needs, translating this to a relational database (SQL Server), and querying. 

## File Structure and Contents
1. [CatalogTable.png](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FreightProject/CatalogTable.png)
    - The catalog snippet that the database will be based on.
2. [FreightERD.png](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FreightProject/FreightERD.png)
    - Contains the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram developed based on the initial design concepts. This diagram details all relevant entities, their attributes, relationships, key constraints, and participations constraints. The model was created using Visio.
3. [FreightRel.sql](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FreightProject/FreightRel.sql)
    - Translates the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram into a relational model and includes SQL scripts for creating the database. This also includes SQL code to populate these tables.
4. [FreightQueries.sql](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Modeling/FreightProject/FreightQueries.sql)
    - Contains queries using SQL to answer various questions about the data.
## Skills
- **Database Design:** Application of structured methods to design a database tailored to the specific needs of a company.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** Creating detailed and accurate ER diagrams to represent complex data relationships and constraints.
- **SQL** Use of SQL for database creation, including table definitions, relationships, constraints, and table population.
- **Querying:** Ability to perform ad-hoc analysis on the database.
