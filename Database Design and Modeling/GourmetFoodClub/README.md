# Gourmet Food Club Database Design
This is a project I created while at Washington State University. This project represents a database for a gourmet food club that wants to track their customers, hosts, and the parties they host. This project showcases my skills in designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram using Visio, translating this to a relational database (SQL Server), and populating tables with data through SQL. 

# Background
The Gourmet Food Club offers food products that they sell at various home parties. The owner, Aimee runs one of the many clubs and would like to track who attends her parties as well as who hosted a party for her. Customers can attend many parties and parties consist of many attendees. Customers may also host parties but parties can only be hosted by one person. Aimee also likes to keep track of who each customer's spouse is if they have one.
