The gourmet food club sells select food products via home parties. Aimee runs one of these
clubs and wants to be able to track who has come to her parties and who has hosted a party for
her. She keeps all contact information about her customers (e.g., name, phone, email, and
address) and tracks the date and time of all parties she has given. A customer may attend many
parties (and of course parties have many attendees) and a customer may also host many parties
(but each party is only hosted by one person). Aimee also likes to keep track of who each
customerâ€™s spouse is (if they have one), but wants to keep an individual record of the customer
and the spouse
