# Department of Licensing Database Design

This is a small database design project I created while studying at Washington State University. This project showcases my skills in designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on company needs, translating this to a relational database (Postgres), and database schema refinement such as normalization and physical design considerations. The project is meant to simulates a real-world scenario where I conceptualized and developed a database for the Department of Licensing. 

## File Structure and Contents
1. [DesignInstructions.md](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/DeptOfLicensing_DBDesign/DesignInstructions.md)
    - Outlines the intital design concepts and considerations for the faux Department of Licensing database.
2. [LD_ERDesign.pdf](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/DeptOfLicensing_DBDesign/LD_ERDesign.pdf)
    - Contains the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram developed based on the initial design concepts. This diagram details all relevant entities, their attributes, relationships, key constraints, and participations constraints.
3. [LD_RelationalMapping.sql](https://github.com/Jade010/SQL/blob/main/DeptOfLicensing_DBDesign/LD_RelationalMapping.sql)
    - Translates the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram into a relational model and includes SQL scripts for creating the database. This file demonstrates the practical application of ER-to-relational mapping techniques and the creation of the database using PostgreSQL.

## Skills
- **Database Design:** Application of structured methods to design a database tailored to the specific needs of a company.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** Creating detailed and accurate ER diagrams to represent complex data relationships and constraints.
- **SQL Development** Use of SQL for database creation, including table definitions, relationships, and constraints.
- **Schema Refinement and Normalization:** Ability to optimize database schema for performance and reliability.
- **Physical Database Design:** Understanding of how to structure a database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
