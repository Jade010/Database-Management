# Constraints & Triggers Projects

## Overview
Within my broader SQL/Database portfolio, this folder is dedicated to showcasing my proficiency in implementing database constraints and triggers. It highlights my ability to enforce data integrity, automate database management tasks, and ensure the reliability of database operations through carefully crafted examples.

## Contents
- **Constraints Examples:** Features SQL scripts and project descriptions focused on the use of constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and NOT NULL. Each example demonstrates how these constraints are applied to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules within database systems.
- **Triggers Demonstrations:** Contains projects that utilize database triggers for automating tasks, enforcing complex business rules, and maintaining audit logs. These examples illustrate the creation and application of triggers in response to specific database events, showcasing the dynamic capabilities of modern database systems.

## Purpose
The Constraints & Triggers folder is designed to provide a clear picture of my technical skills in using advanced SQL features to create robust, reliable, and efficient database solutions. It serves as a testament to my ability to enhance data integrity, automate processes, and implement complex business logic directly within the database layer.
